# Sentiment-Analysis
 Twitter Sentiment Analysis using NLP.
- Objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

- Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label ‘1’ denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label ‘0’ denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, objective is to predict the labels on the given test dataset.

- The evaluation metric used is F1-Score. It is a measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score.

- I will be building predictive models on the dataset using the two feature set — Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF.I will use logistic regression to build the models. It predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function.
